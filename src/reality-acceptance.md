This is a DBT Reality Acceptance flowchart. It uses the skills from Marsha Linehan's book.

These skills are meant to be learned in a DBT skills class, or one-on-one with a therapist (DBT is an entire therapy modality); however, if you have access to neither, the materials are below to explain what each of the skills are.

The chart is meant to serve as a printable shorthand to help re-train behavior to ease day-to-day emotional turmoil.
