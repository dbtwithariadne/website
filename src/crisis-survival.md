# DBT Crisis Survival Skills

This is a DBT Crisis Survival and Distress Tolerance flowchart. It uses the skills from Marsha Linehan's book.

I made it for my fridge, because when I'm in crisis, I can't really remember anything.

The chart is meant to serve as a printable shorthand in-crisis reminder to use skills vs *making the crisis worse.*
